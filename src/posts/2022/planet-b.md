Whoops, I've got a big new project and I forgot to post anything about it here. Proper documentation will be included in my [project timeline](https://benjaminandrew.net/projects/) at some point, for now:

🥁 🥁 🥁

[Planet B](https://planetbstory.com) is a serial fiction newsletter (one novella-length story released in twice-weekly installments). It’s also a digital art project of sorts, with digital designs, fake ads, and [spinoff-websites](https://www.agipan.com/) from the world of the story to enrich the reading experience. 

It’s a story about the climate crisis, technology, and the drive to make a better world — but with some mercenaries and globe-trotting espionage to spice things up. Each chapter is designed to be read quickly, like a newsletter, so I hope you can find time to join the story over the coming weeks. 

You can [subscribe](https://buttondown.email/planetb) to get new chapters via email every Tuesday and Friday, or follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlanetBStory) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/planetbstory/). All published chapters will be available on the [project website](https://planetbstory.com).

Here's the official synopsis:

> As Earth’s climate collapses, an influential tech company has built a portal to a habitable world on the other side of the galaxy — and they're not going to screw this one up. <br><br> To gain admittance, you must prove your skills, morality, and sustainability on the battlefield of social media. Powerful forces are are determined to find the portal: governments, billionaires… a young reporter looking for a big break, and a mercenary hacker whose sister becomes the latest recruit for the off-world utopia. But so far, the portal remains hidden.
