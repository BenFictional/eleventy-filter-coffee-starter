After working with a variety of political and activist groups in the wake of the 2016 election, I created core brand assets for Democratic candidate Marc Friedenberg, a first-time candidate and fellow professor at Penn State. 

I also created a custom Wordpress theme for the campaign website, and a wide range of printed flyers, stickers, buttons, and more. After Marc lost the 2018 election \(it's an R+17 district ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\), I continued working with the campaign in a 2019 special election, where I coordinated digital ad strategy with a national design firm. 

The central logo for the campaign was inspired by the mountains of central Pennsylvania and the candidate's dedication to protecting the environment, with the elements suggesting a river flowing beneath a pair of mountains.

Among the videos and one-off ads produced for the campaign, my favorite was probably the standalone website Crooked Tom, summarizing the corrupt tendencies of our 2018 opponent, Tom Marino.
