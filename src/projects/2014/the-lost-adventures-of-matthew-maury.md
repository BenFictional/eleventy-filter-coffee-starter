This site-specifc exhibition explores the fictional world of the [Chronoecology Corps](/projects/2013/chronoecology-corps) alongside the history of [Matthew Fontaine Maury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Fontaine_Maury): a prolific American scientist and namesake of the building where the exhibition took place. The exhibition tells the story of how Maury supposedly departed the 19th century for a joint scientific mission throughout time and space with the Corps.

Actual charts and documents from Maury's careers in oceanography and astronomy are shown alongside objects relating to the Corps' own mission of natural curiosity. Many of the scientific documents are paired with futuristic devices that simulate natural phenomena for viewers to interact with. This mix of art and science is also developed by artifacts and photographs of past Chronoecology Corps performances, genuine relics that twist temporary public art into a traditional museum exhibit. Altered historical photographs show Maury traveling through time with the Corps, and many other elements in the show confuse fact and fiction.
