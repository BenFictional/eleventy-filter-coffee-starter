This was a quick logo design for a cool research initiative sponsored by the Council on Library and Information Resources. The [Hub for AI Research in Archives](https://haira.clir.org/) \(HAIRA\) is an interdisciplinary effort to equip archival researchers with cutting edge computing tools. 

The brief for the logo was to keep the design tethered to the humanities, and play with a particular glyph from the [Bassa language](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/bassa.htm) from central Africa. The glyph roughly corresponded to the letter "A" for A.I.
