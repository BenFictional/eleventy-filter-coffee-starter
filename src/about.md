## Selected Press

> “The element of surprise seems like the only given for a film that is intended to function as sort of a mad scientist’s experiment in storytelling.”

Frank Ready, [Centre Daily Times](https://account.centredaily.com/paywall/subscriber-only?resume=180048156&intcid=ab_archive)

> “The standout in the show… an outdoor sculpture biennial in Foggy Bottom [that] has no right to be as good as this one does.”

Kriston Capps, [Washington City Paper](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/328976/turf-and-terrain-at-arts-in-foggy-bottom-reviewed/)

> “My favorite work in the show, it’s sci-fi nerdy and wonderfully playful”
